Overview:
    Functions for a lot of purposes (mainly, numerical analysys) like below:
    Gauss Jordan iteration method
    Power method
    Least square method
    etc.

Description:
    this repository made up with 2 main folders.
    One is lib folder, another is src folder.
    The formar one includes source files and header files for functions.
    The latter one contains folders and files to test functions.
    (The src folder also contains indepandent c files for simple test.)

    lib folder
    The formar one includes source files and header files for functions.
    for example, you can use gauss_jordan_iteration by including
    gauss_jordan_iteration_method.h.

    src folder
    includes subfolders and .c files.
    Naked .c files are independent from lib/*.h, and be able to
    compiled without make file.
    Subfolders has Makefile suited for main.c. The main.c file in the subfolder
    is depending on lib/*.h. You can use Makefile to build.

Feature:
    cording rules:

    1. Use data types defined in <stdint.h>.
       This is for platform differnce.

       Some of data type has different length in different CPU.
       For example, 8 bit microchips like PIC16F877 has 8bit integer,
       thought my PC has 32bit integer.
       This rule prevents potential probrems caused by datasize, such as
       unexpected overflow.

    2. Give the comment for all fuctions.
       This is for maintainability.

       It is necessary for proper use of these funcions.
       The comment must be the same in source file and header file.

    3. function arguments patterns should follow the rules below
       This is for usefullness.

       a. VO format naming is prefered.
       a. pointer for array must be xxx[], not xxx*
       b. the order of arguments is <data pointer> <solution poiter>
          <initial consitions> <other conditions>.
